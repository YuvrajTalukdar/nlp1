Every Black Hole Is A Universe.
Introduction: Our Present Big Bang Model Has A Lot Of Problems Like What Was There Before The Big Bang Etc. My Model Seems To Be Better From That Point Of View. It Tells That Every Black Holes Are A Universe By Itself. It Might Seem Strange And Full Of Problems But I Have Managed Find Solution To Almost All Of The Problems. I Dont Have Enough Mathematical Know How, So I Tried To Prove It By Contradictory Method To Prove It.
The Following Are The Problems With Solutions
What About The Big Bang?
Ans) At The Time Of Big Bang The Entire Universe Started To Expand Enormously All Of A Sudden Giving Out A Huge Amount Of Energy. If We Consider A Black Hole A Universe, Than The Supernova Explosion After Which The Black Hole Was Formed Can Be Considered As The Big Bang Explosion. 
Why Don’t Life Get Destroyed In A Black Hole Because Of Super Gravity?
Ans) OK Let’s Forget The Question For Some Time. What Will Happen If We Increase All The Forces Of The Universe By A 1000000000 Times?
I Don’t Think Anything Special Or Remarkable Would Happen If We Succeed To Do So Because All The Forces Wound Cancel Each Other. That’s The Same Thing What Happens With A Black Holes. In A Black Hole The Power Of The Gravity May Be High But Inside The Forces Of The Particles Are Also High So They Cancel Up. But This Does Not Mean That The Form Of Particles Inside And Outside The Black Hole Would Be Same. The Amount Of Energy Required To Break Atoms Is Much Higher Than That Of Molecules, So It Is Likely The Particles In A Black Hole Is Much Likely To Be In Sub-atomic Form. Till Today The Elementary Particle Of Matter Haven’t Been Found, So We Can Accept That The Quarks Can Be Also Composed Of Even Smaller Particles. So What Is Quarks For Us Can Me Atoms For Someone Living In A Black Hole.
What Is The Dark Energy Which Is Believed To Have Its Hand In Expansion Of The Universe? 
When A Something Enters A Black Hole, It Grows Bigger. So If We Take Our Universe As A Black Hole Than It Must Be Soloing Matter Outside It That Is Why It Is Expanding. This Is What Dark Energy Is According To My Model.
What Will Be The Shape Of The Universe Than?
